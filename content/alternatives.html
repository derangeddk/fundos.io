    <h1>Fundos.io compared to alternatives</h1>
    <p>
        There are other organisations moving towards making it easier to get paid for developing Open Source code.
        What are the differences between these and Fundos.io?
        Why is Fundos.io unique?
    </p>
    <h2>Gratipay helps companies and others pay for software</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://gratipay.com/" target="_blank">Gratipay</a> is a small company that allows maintainers to sign up their open source project, and then start taking donations.
        Gratipay, at the <span title="2017-07-13" class="hint">time of writing</span> distributes around $10 000 every month.
    </p>
    <p>
        Money donated through Gratipay goes to the creator of a project.
        Unlike Fundos.io, then, it is not easy to incentivize new contributions, as they will have to be distributed by maintainers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gratipay is a good option for small projects with a set group of contributors, but does not necessarily support the distribution of donations easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        One neat feature of Gratipay is that it helps you find projects to support by reading your package.json-file.
        It is, however, not possible to automatically donate parts of ones donations to other projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        All distribution of money using Gratipay would have to happen after the 2% withdrawal fee (PayPal's doing, not Gratipay's), and would require significant work with more than just a very few involved developers or dependent projects to donate to.
    </p>
    <h2>OpenCollective is a new form of association</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://opencollective.com/" target="_blank">OpenCollective</a> helps various organisations (open source projects, meetups) show their budgets to users, and ask for contributions.
        Like Gratipay, it allows for weekly contributions.
        <span title="2017-07-13" class="hint">Currently</span>, around $30 000 per month flows through the system to Open Source Software projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Money donated through OpenCollective is currently generally spent on project expenses, such as infrastructure and communication, and not on developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The structure of the software makes this most usable for larger projects with larger expenses.
        It is not straight forward to use it as a money distribution mechanism.
        (This would, once again, require significant organisational work.)
    </p>
    <h2>What if the alternatives start supporting Fundos.io unique features?</h2>
    <p>
        Competition is healthy!
        We are building Fundos.io the way we think is best, but if alternatives can make the features work in their model, we hope they do!
        We want to build the features because we think they are <em>good for the ecosystem</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice that we deliberately use the term <em>alternatives</em> rather than competitors: we do not see ourselves as being in competition with these other organizations.
        We want to provide an alternative for a niche they are currently not actively targeting.
