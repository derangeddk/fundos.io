    <h1>The current model is broken</h1>
    <p>
        Open Source software is used in most software today.
        It is interacted with by billions of people on a daily basis.
        And much of it was built by developers who did not get paid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Open Source software must be maintained and updated in order to be useful.
        Software is never finished.
        Open Source software development often ends up taking a lot of effort and time to properly manage.
        And too often Open Source developers end up feeling obligated to keep maintaining the projects they started, even when it is no longer useful to themselves, and still without compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result: Open Source software is a source of stress for many creators, risks being abandoned altogether, or not updated to deal with vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
        This brings a lot of pain for all parties invovled, users and creators.

        Some Open Source projects (larger ones, in code size or user bases, but usually both) have established foundations in order to fund raise and fund the projects.
        By now, quite a few of such foundations exist.
        Unfortunately, this is rarely an option for mid-sized or smaller open source projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to ensure that certain Open Source projects are maintained properly, some (large) companies invest in employees that work full time.
        This, again, is mostly directed at larger projects, or projects originating from the company itself.
        In addition, this often creates an issue of loyalty: these employees are more likely to consider the best actions for their company than for the project, because they are monetarily incentivized to do so.
        Mid-sized and small projects rarely get full-time resources allocated to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        We see two problems:
        it is too hard for developers of small or mid-sized Open Source projects to be compensated; and it is too hard to small or mid-sized companies to help fund Open Source development.

<section id="it-must-be-made-easier-to-support-open-source-software-creation">
    <h1>It must be made easier to support Open Source Software creation</h1>
    <p>
        Fundos.io (pronounced <em>fund us</em> but also an abbreviation of the imperative <strong>Fund O</strong>pen <strong>S</strong>ource) is a vision of a platform for Open Source Software funding.
        The concept is inspired by other crowdfunding services on the internet, but directed directly at and built for Open Source Software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Individuals or companies can pledge an amount of money to the projects they wish to fund, and the amount will be charged monthly.
        This makes it more approachable for businesses with smaller budgets to help in the funding of Open Source Software, and at the same time avoid the issue of loyalty, as developers are now paid for their work on a project, not their work for any individual company.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the developer side, maintainers will be able to set up how the money given to the project is split between collaborators.
        For example, to encourage outside help, one might reward non-maintainers who contribute code, raise important issues, or write documentation for the project.
        Fundos.io will automatically allocate the funds and allow developers to claim them, or donate them to a charity of their choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, a the maintainers of a project might descide to allocate a certain amount of the incoming funds for other Open Source projects that the project itself depends on.
        This allows for the funding of less well-known or well-branded projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transparency is in the spirit of Open Source, but it is often not apparent how money is spent once donated to a foundation.
        Fundos.io will make it more explicitly visible how money is allocated once donated to a project, allowing for funding decisions to be made based on all the relevant information.
