    <h1>Fundos.io, the company</h1>
    <p>
        Fundos.io will be run as a company, because we will be dealing with people's money.
        In the name of transparency, here are the plans for company structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        At <a href="http://deranged.dk" target="_blank">deranged</a> we believe strongly in Open Source, and so all of the source code for the project will be released under a free-to-use (including for commercial purposes) license.
        This fits with our existing business strategies and has an important implication: we need to also deliver on service and support in order to keep running.
        If we do poorly, the project can be forked and taken up by other entities, to run in a different way.
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan on compensating contributors to the software.
        That's what we are building a platform for, and part of our revenue will go towards paying contributors to the project.
        In fact, after paying for staff, infrastructure, etc. <em>at least</em> 50% of our profits will go to paying contributors.
        We are not in this to make a buck, and will not pay out anything to company owners.
        (This can be verified by checking the accounts for the company, which are public in Denmark.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Now for revenue.
        How are we planning on getting any?
        Here, the model will be very much like other crowdfunding platforms, where a percentage of the money paid goes to the platform.
        Unlike other crowdfunding platforms, however, we will make it abundantly clear exactly how the money is split, both to maintainers of projects and to users (companies or individuals) pledging funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, this is a project that comes from the heart: we strongly believe developers should be paid for their work, whether it's source code be open or closed.
        We are not in this to make a profit.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not take outside funding.
        We aim to make the platform sustainable, and grow it at the rate that reveals itself to be possible.
        It is not a goal in and of itself to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are just building a platform supporting something that we strongly believe in.
        If you believe in it, too, we hope you will convince your employer to donate to Open Source projects they use, when the platform launches.
    </p>
