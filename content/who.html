    <h1>Who is building this?</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="http://deranged.dk" target="_blank">deranged</a> is a small consultancy out of Copenhagen that loves Open Source (we make as much of our code as possible easily available to other developers) and getting paid for work (in fact, we insist).
    </p>
    <p>
        We are currently the main driving force behind the project.
        If you want to help the project come about, you should totally <a href="mailto:get@deranged.dk">refer consultancy work to us</a>.
        We appreciate it. ðŸ™‚
    </p>

        The current contributors to the project are:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://hypesystem.dk/">Niels Roesen Abildgaard</a> (<a href="https://github.com/hypesystem/">github</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hypesystem">twitter</a>) from <a href="http://deranged.dk">deranged</a></li>
